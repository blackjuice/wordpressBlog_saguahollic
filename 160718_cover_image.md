# Cover Image?

The cover image for this blog is a screenshot from a little house I created in **Minecraft** (*creative mode*). I wish I had the map here, but unfortunately I deleted the file =(.

But I still have some pics here... For these screenshots, the following shaders and textures were used:

* Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders
* Chroma Hills textures
